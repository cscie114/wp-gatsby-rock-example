# Wordpress + Gatsby Example

This is an example using [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) as a headless CMS with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as the frontend.

## Quickstart

To setup a local development environment for WordPress, you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

```
docker compose up
cd gatsby
npm install
npm run develop
```

To access WordPress:
- WordPress Admin: http://localhost:8080/wp-admin
- Gatsby Frontend: http://locahost:8000/
